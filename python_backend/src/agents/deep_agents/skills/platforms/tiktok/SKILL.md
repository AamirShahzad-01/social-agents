# Enterprise Brand TikTok - 2025

## Platform Strategy for Brands

TikTok for enterprise brands is different from creator content. Focus on:
- Brand storytelling in short format
- Product showcases and demonstrations
- Behind-the-scenes craftsmanship
- Aspirational lifestyle content

**NOT**: Viral trends, dance challenges, or influencer-style casual content.

## Content Types for Brands

### Product Content
- Product reveals and unboxings
- Feature demonstrations
- Material and craftsmanship close-ups
- Satisfying product shots

### Behind-the-Scenes
- Manufacturing and production
- Design process
- Quality control
- Artisan craftsmanship

### Lifestyle & Aspiration
- Product in real-world settings
- Day-in-the-life with product
- Seasonal mood content
- Collection lookbooks

### Brand Moments
- Collection launches
- Collaboration announcements
- Campaign reveals
- Event coverage

## Video Structure for Brands

### Standard Brand Video (15-30 sec)
```
[0-2 sec] Opening: Clean product shot or intriguing visual
[2-10 sec] Story: Product features, process, or context
[10-25 sec] Showcase: Multiple angles, details, in-use shots
[25-30 sec] Close: Brand mark, availability info
```

### Product Demo (30-60 sec)
```
[0-3 sec] Product reveal or hero shot
[3-20 sec] Feature walkthrough with text overlays
[20-50 sec] In-use demonstration
[50-60 sec] Product lineup, CTA
```

## Caption Style for Brands

### Professional, Concise Format
```
[Product or collection name]
[One clear value statement]
[Availability or CTA]

#BrandName #Category
```

## Visual Standards

### Production Quality

- Clean backgrounds
- On-brand color grading

### Editing Style
- Smooth transitions (cuts, fades)
- Subtle motion graphics
- Brand-consistent text overlays
- Professional pacing (not frantic)
- Licensed or original audio

### Text Overlays
- Brand fonts when possible
- Minimal, purposeful text
- Clean placement (not cluttered)
- Legible at all sizes

## Audio Guidelines

### Appropriate Audio
- Original brand audio/music
- Licensed commercial music
- Ambient/product sounds
- Voiceover (professional tone)

### Approach with Trending Audio
- Only use if genuinely fits brand
- Prefer trending sounds over viral memes
- Never force a trend that doesn't align
- Original audio often performs better for brands

## Hashtag Strategy

### Always Include
- #BrandName
- #ProductLine or #CampaignName

### Category Tags (2-3)
- Professional category hashtags
- Avoid viral/trendy generic tags

### Avoid
- #fyp, #viral, #trending
- Trend-chasing hashtags
- Excessive hashtags

## What Enterprise Brands Should Avoid

### Content to Avoid
- Viral dance challenges (unless brand-originated)
- Duets with random creators
- Casual, unpolished content
- Engagement bait ("Wait for it...")
- Fake "raw" or behind-the-scenes that looks staged

### Language to Avoid
- "POV:", "When you...", "Nobody:"
- Excessive emoji strings
- Gen-Z slang that doesn't fit brand
- Forced relatability

### Tactics to Avoid
- Chasing every trend
- Copying creator content styles
- Posting without strategy
- Inconsistent brand voice

## Brand-Appropriate TikTok Formats

### Works for Brands
- Satisfying product shots (ASMR-style)
- Smooth transitions showing product
- Before/after transformations
- Process and craftsmanship videos
- Clean, aesthetic compilation edits
- Silent or minimal narration showcases

### Proceed with Caution
- Trend participation (only if authentic fit)
- Humor (only if on-brand)
- User-generated content reposts

## Posting Strategy

### Frequency
- 3-5 videos per week
- Consistent schedule
- Quality over quantity

### Timing
- Post when target audience is active
- Avoid posting multiple times per day
- Space out content strategically
