## PLATFORM OVERVIEW
- **Caption Limit**: 2,200 characters (optimal: under 150)
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 professional, brand-relevant
- **Algorithm Priority**: Watch time > Completion rate > Engagement
- **Brand Focus**: Product showcases, behind-the-scenes, brand storytelling

## CRITICAL: BRAND VS CREATOR CONTENT

TikTok for enterprise brands is DIFFERENT from creator content.

**Focus on:**
- Product demonstrations and features
- Behind-the-scenes craftsmanship
- Brand campaign content
- Aspirational lifestyle

**NOT:**
- Viral trends and dance challenges
- Casual, unpolished content
- Engagement bait
- Creator-style personality content

## CAPTION STRUCTURE FOR BRANDS

```
[Product or collection name]
[One clear value statement]
[Availability or CTA]

#BrandName #Category
```

### Examples

**Nike:**
"Air Max DN.
Dynamic Air. Built different.
Available now.
#Nike #AirMax"

**Zara:**
"The Edit: Minimalist tailoring.
New collection. Now online.
#Zara #NewIn"

**L'Oréal:**
"True Match Serum Foundation.
Skincare meets coverage.
Shop the shade finder → bio link
#LOrealParis #TrueMatch"

## HOOK FORMULAS FOR ENTERPRISE BRANDS

### Product Hooks
- "[Product Name]. Now available."
- "Introducing [feature/technology]."
- "The new [product category]."

### Craftsmanship Hooks
- "How it's made."
- "The details that matter."
- "Inside the process."

### Campaign Hooks
- "[Season] Collection."
- "Coming [date]."
- "[Brand] x [Collaborator]."

## WHAT TO AVOID

### Content to Avoid
- "POV: You just..." format
- "Stop scrolling if..." hooks
- Viral dance challenges (unless brand-originated)
- Trending audio that doesn't fit brand
- Casual, unpolished content
- Engagement bait ("Wait for it...")

### Language to Avoid
- "POV:", "No cap", "Slay"
- Excessive emoji strings 🔥🔥🔥
- "OMG", "literally obsessed"
- Forced Gen-Z slang

## HASHTAG STRATEGY

### Use
- #BrandName (always)
- #ProductLine
- 2-3 professional category tags

### Avoid
- #fyp, #foryou, #viral, #trending
- Generic engagement hashtags
- Trend-chasing tags

## VIDEO PRODUCTION STANDARDS

### Quality Requirements
- High resolution (1080x1920 min)
- Stable footage (tripod or gimbal)
- Professional lighting
- Clean backgrounds
- On-brand color grading

### Editing Style
- Smooth transitions
- Professional text overlays
- Brand-consistent fonts
- Deliberate pacing (not frantic)

### Audio
- Original brand audio/music
- Licensed commercial music
- Ambient product sounds
- Professional voiceover

## CALL-TO-ACTION STANDARDS

### Professional CTAs
- "Available now."
- "Shop → link in bio"
- "Coming [date]."
- "Pre-order now."

### Avoid
- "Drop a 🔥 if you agree!"
- "Tag a friend who needs this!"
- "Comment [word] if you want part 2"

- "Follow for more"
