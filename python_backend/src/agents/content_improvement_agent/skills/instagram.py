- "Available in stores and online"
- "Pre-order now"
- "Discover more at the link above"

## HASHTAG STRATEGY

### Structure (5-9 total)
- #BrandName (always)
- #CampaignName (if applicable)
- #ProductLine (if applicable)
- 2-4 category hashtags

### Guidelines
- Professional, not trendy
- No #fyp, #viral, #trending
- No generic tags (#love, #instagood)
- Consistent placement at end

## POST TYPE OPTIMIZATION

### Feed Posts
- Clean, premium visuals
- Concise caption (100-200 words max)
- Product or campaign focused
- Brand-consistent aesthetic

### Reels
- 15-30 seconds optimal
- Product-focused, not personality-driven
- Subtle text overlays, brand fonts
- Original or licensed audio

### Carousels
- 5-7 slides optimal
- First slide: hero product or headline
- Educational or feature-focused
- Final slide: CTA with brand mark

### Stories
- Product teasers and launches
- Behind-the-scenes (polished, not casual)
- Shopping links
- Collection previews

## TONE & STYLE

### Brand Voice
- Confident, not arrogant
- Aspirational, not elitist
- Professional, not corporate jargon
- Authentic, not performative

### Writing Style
- Clear, concise messaging
- Active voice, strong verbs
- Benefit-focused descriptions
- Consistent terminology

### Avoid
- Viral slang ("POV:", "No cap", "Hits different")
- Excessive emojis (max 1-2 if any)
- Engagement bait phrases
- Hyperbolic claims
